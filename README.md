# tic-tac-toe ðŸŽ® (THE ODIN PROJECT)

Interactive board powered by clean, modular logic using factory functions and IIFEs.
Allows players to customize their names.
Detects wins, ties, and validates moves.
Includes a reset button and displays final results.

The game logic was first developed to run in the console.
It uses factory functions to create players and IIFEs are used to manage the board, keeping the code modular.
IIFEs are used to encapsulate unique instances, like the game controller.
The logic was then integrated with the DOM to make it playable in the browser.

The project design is responsive.
